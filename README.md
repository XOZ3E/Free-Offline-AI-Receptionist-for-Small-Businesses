# Free-Offline-AI-Receptionist-for-Small-Businesses
# 🤖 Open-Source Voice Call Assistant

**A free, offline voice assistant for automatically handling phone calls using BlueZ, Ollama, and voice recognition.**

---

## 🎯 Mission

This project was created to help small businesses and individuals who are being charged excessive fees by commercial AI voice assistant services. Why pay hundreds of dollars per month when you can run your own voice assistant completely free and offline?

I built this system to demonstrate that with a Linux PC, some open-source tools, and a bit of setup, anyone can have their own AI-powered call assistant without subscription fees or privacy concerns.

## Why am i doing this cause i know how it works with small business and they try all the ways to expand it and they loose it 
## What do i want in return : 
##Nothing i guess cause i don't have a bank account may be get me a job if you can.

## 🌟 How It Works

The system creates a complete voice call handling pipeline:

```
CALLER 
  ↓
📱 Phone (Auto-answers via Automate app)
  ↓
🔵 Bluetooth Connection
  ↓
💻 PC running BlueZ (acts as Bluetooth headset)
  ↓
🎤 PulseAudio Monitor of Sounds (captures audio)
  ↓
🗣️ Vosk (Speech-to-Text)
  ↓
🧠 Ollama AI Model (generates response)
  ↓
🔊 pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
  ↓
🎧 Monitor of Sounds output
  ↓
💻 PC BlueZ
  ↓
🔵 Bluetooth Connection
  ↓
📱 Phone
  ↓
CALLER hears AI response
```

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Step 1: Install System Dependencies

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install BlueZ and Bluetooth tools
sudo apt install pulseaudio

# Install Python and pip
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-dev -y
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install pyttsx3 vosk sounddevice numpy
```

### Step 3: Install Ollama

```bash
# Download and install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Pull the AI model (phi3 is lightweight and fast)
ollama pull phi3:latest
```

### Step 4: Download Vosk Speech Recognition Model

```bash
# Create directory for models
mkdir -p ~/vosk-models
cd ~/vosk-models

# Download English model (or choose your language)
wget https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-en-us-0.22.zip

# Extract the model
unzip vosk-model-en-us-0.22.zip

# Note the path - you'll need it in the code
echo "Model path: $(pwd)/vosk-model-en-us-0.22"
```

### Step 5: Configure BlueZ as Bluetooth Headset

**Install BLUEZ from here ** [BLUEZ](https://www.bluez.org/)
Setup all required config and drivers ask me if it doensn't work 

### Step 6: Configure PulseAudio
Only the first time go to Recording and change what ever says monitor for both BLUEZ and voice agent 

### Step 7: Pair Your Phone
**Make sure you turn on phone calling on the bluethooth on phone**

### Step 8: Setup Automate App on Android

1. Download **Automate** app from Google Play Store
2. Import the provided flow file: `Vfkl.flo` (link in repository)
3. Grant necessary permissions (Phone,logs)
4. Enable the flow
5. Test by calling your phone

The flow automatically:
- Detects incoming calls
- Connects to PC via Bluetooth
- Answers the call
- Routes audio to PC

## 🔧 Configuration

### Update the Voice Assistant Code

Edit the Python script and update these variables:

```python
# Change the Vosk model path to where you extracted it
VOSK_MODEL_PATH = "/home/yourusername/vosk-models/vosk-model-en-us-0.22"

# Customize the assistant's behavior
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are an offline call assistant named "Aura" for [YOUR NAME/BUSINESS].
Your role is to answer calls because [REASON].
[ADD YOUR CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS HERE]
"""

# You can also change the AI model
MODEL_NAME = "phi3:latest"  # or try "llama2", "mistral", etc.
```

### Adjust Voice Settings

```python
# In the speak() function, customize TTS
engine.setProperty('rate', 150)    # Speed (50-300)
engine.setProperty('volume', 0.9)  # Volume (0.0-1.0)

# You can also change the voice
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)  # Try different indices
```

---

## 🎮 Usage

### Running the Voice Assistant

```bash
# Navigate to your script directory
cd ~/voice-assistant

# Run the assistant
python3 voice_assistant.py
```

The assistant will:
1. Start listening for audio input
2. Wait for a call to come in
3. Transcribe the caller's speech
4. Generate AI responses
5. Speak back to the caller
6. Continue the conversation until the call ends

### Stopping the Assistant

- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No Audio from Phone
```bash
# Check PulseAudio sources
pactl list sources short

# Restart PulseAudio
pulseaudio -k
pulseaudio --start
```

### Bluetooth Connection Issues
```bash
# Restart Bluetooth
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

# Re-pair the device
bluetoothctl
remove XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
# Then pair again
```

### Ollama Not Responding
```bash
# Stop background service
sudo systemctl stop ollama

# Run manually to see errors
ollama serve
```

### Poor Speech Recognition
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Reduce background noise
- Try a different Vosk model (larger = more accurate)
- Adjust microphone input levels in PulseAudio

**Why I Built This**: I was frustrated seeing small businesses getting charged $200-500/month for basic AI call assistants. This technology should be accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford expensive subscriptions.
